Mininet Extreme Installation/Configuration Notes
----------------------------------------

1. Clone the repository to a chosen location

2. Installation

  To install dependencies on Ubuntu 12.10+ in developer mode (including Quagga, OpenVPN):

      `sudo mininet-extreme/util/install.sh -foqvz`

  Note: this installs Quagga and patches /etc/init.d/quagga
   
3. Launching an example topology

  The following will launch a Mininet network consisting of a legacy switch and five
  Quagga routers (legacy routers). Each Quagga router will read from its own configuration
  space, stored within `mininet-extreme/examples/quaggacfgs/NAME`. In addition, each
  Quagga instance will log to it's own location within `/var/log/quagga-` and store its
  PID files within `/run/quagga-NAME`. This directories will be automatically created and
  permissions will be automatically configured

      `sudo python mininet-extreme/examples/quagga.py`
      
  It is recommended that you do not attempt to access the `bgpd` console directly from
  the Mininet shell, as there are some incompatibilities. Instead, use the following to
  connect to a Quagga `bgpd` console:
  
      # launch a shell in the container namespace
      `mininet-extreme/util/m <container name (a1, b1, rs, etc)>`
      
      # connect to bgpd via netcat
      `nc localhost 2605`
      `password: bgpuser`

4. Removing Mininet Extreme

  To remove the core Mininet Extreme binaries and libraries:

      `sudo python mininet-extreme/setup.py develop --uninstall`

  Note: this does not remove dependencies, such as Quagga

Good luck!
